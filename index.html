                Nathan is a San Francisco State University student majoring in Visual Communication 
                Design. Before transferring to San Francisco State, he had attended City College of 
                San Francisco. After a couple of years of trying out different majors at CCSF, Nathan 
                decided to pursue Visual Communication Design. It was then that he knew he found the 
                right major. Nathan had always had an affinity to creativity. As a child, drawing was 
                one of the things that he had done often. Although drawing didn't seem like a stable 
                major, he instead chose to pursue Visual Communication Design and has never looked back since.
